    <p>The rollout of Morphowave technology across BU dining halls has been a concerning effort on BU’s part. These funky-looking biometric scanners that supposedly speed up the process of dining hall entry have been a headache for many as many ask what the point of these new scanners are. Although it may not seem like it, these new biometric scanners give insight into an ever-increasing conflict arising between consumers and large corporations.</p>
   
    <p>Biometric scanning is becoming a prevalent way of accessing places or objects. Many people have fingerprint scanners or facial recognition on their phones or computers because of the convenience allotted by this software. As a result, many campuses are using this by implementing biometric scanners, like those of Morphowave, into daily student life. Yet the rollout of the technology here at Boston University has been not only forceful but without the consent of the student body. Here are a multitude of reasons, such as the lack of clarity from dining hall services about how extensive Morphowave tech would be used and the way these products have been pushed to students, as well as the potential consequences of giving this information to a third party are all great reasons for concern if you’re a student here at BU.</p>
   
    <p>There was immense confusion suffered by many as they strolled into Warren dining hall and saw a sign that signaled the end of the Terrier Card era and the beginning of the hand-waving era. Many were rightly taken aback as this shift in policy was concerning to those who had ethical concerns or just security concerns. The lack of transparency on BU’s part prompted members of Technopolis to reach out to the dining services to state and make our concerns known to the administration. Much to our surprise, after notifying BU Auxiliary Services of these concerns, we were notified by the Media Director they had no clue that such a policy was being marketed toward students as they stated, “There are no plans to phase out Terrier Cards on campus, including in the dining halls. The Morpho technology is simply another tool that students may use to gain entrance into our dining halls.” If the administration is not aware of the direct contradictions being made, then how can we as students trust the decisions being made behind the scenes?</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the amount of trust BU expects us to put into a biometric system is unrealistic. Regardless if biometric entry is a good or convenient way of going about our daily routines, the storage of biometric data has a greater chance of risk involved when using it. Assurances of safety were made by BU through an email explaining that “the Morphowave reader scans biometric points on your hand… these points are converted into binary code and your fingerprint scans are then deleted. These points are stored securely and cannot be translated back into fingerprints.” However, the true level of security comes into question as biometric data breaches are becoming more common as society becomes more reliant on these forms of security. Even if actions are taken to safeguard a user’s biometric information, it is still possible for corporations to sell this biometric data with or without a user’s consent. This is where a lot of modern legislation regarding biometric data comes into play. There are currently 6 states that have implemented legislation that protects a citizen’s right to unethical use of their biometric data (bclplaw). Biometric data collection is riskier than typical data collection because of the direct tie to a user’s person which makes the recovery of compromised data more difficult. You can always update passwords or documents; you cannot easily change your fingerprints or face(Bloomberg Law). The potential of biometric identity theft should terrify all who partake in this digitized world.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, BU’s decision to implement such a controversial technology has created confusion among the student body. The convenience of scanning your hand does not drastically outweigh the extra second it takes to swipe a card, as well as the higher risk biometrics pose. A switch to biometric scanners at a dorm entry point may be a better alternative, because once more what is the need for a biometric scanner when a student wants a sandwich?</p>

    <p>In the era of advanced artificial intelligence, distinguishing between human and AI-generated text has emerged as an intricate puzzle, with ChatGPT at its heart. This powerful language model poses an exceptionally challenging task when it comes to identifying its outputs, owing to its design that withholds access to responses across chats and the infinite array of prompts users can input.</p>

    One of the central obstacles in recognizing ChatGPT's work lies in its astonishing adaptability. The model can seamlessly mold its writing style to fit various contexts, rendering it nearly indistinguishable from human-generated content. This adaptability is a result of extensive training on a diverse dataset, enabling ChatGPT to produce context-aware responses that blur the lines between human and AI-generated text.
    <br>
    <br>
    Adding to the complexity is ChatGPT's design, which refrains from providing access to responses across different chat sessions. Each interaction with the model exists in isolation, without a window into its prior responses or prompts from other users. This intrinsic lack of transparency hinders efforts to uncover patterns that could reveal AI-authored content.
    <br>
    <br>
    Compounding the challenge is the fact that users can input an endless variety of prompts into ChatGPT. From innocuous queries to potentially harmful content, the sheer volume of possible inputs makes identifying ChatGPT's contributions within this vast ocean of interactions an immensely formidable task.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the face of these daunting hurdles, researchers and developers continue to grapple with inventive approaches to distinguish AI-generated text from human writing. However, as models like ChatGPT persistently evolve and adapt, the task of identifying their work remains a Herculean endeavor, highlighting the ever-expanding complexity of AI in our digital world.

    Did you notice this article was written by ChatGPT? If not, point proven! At this point, AI written content can be nearly unintelligible from its human-created counterpart. Imagine how difficult it could become with further AI development!
